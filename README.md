# illustrator-batch-svg-script
Illustrator script boilerplate to batch-process svg images, such as converting strokes to fills.

I made this to batch-convert a stroke-based set of SVG icons into fill-based shapes for porting into a different design system. It opens a folder of SVG images and runs some Illustrator menu commands against them, before saving them in another folder and closing them. It also does some file name mutations and sorts the files into new folders based on the icon size.  Feel free to take this script and modify it to your heart's content.
